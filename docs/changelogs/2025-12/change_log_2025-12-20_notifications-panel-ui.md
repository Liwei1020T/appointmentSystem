## Summary
Improved the notifications side panel layout so it no longer overlaps the navbar and made each item easier to scan.

## Changes
- Adjusted notification panel overlay and container to start below the navbar and respect the header height.
- Enhanced notification item layout with clearer type badges, time placement, and read-state emphasis.
- Updated filter labels to show unread counts for faster scanning.

## Tests
- Manual UI check: open notifications panel and confirm it does not cover the navbar.
- Manual UI check: verify unread/read styling and type badges are visible.
